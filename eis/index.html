	<p>May 2011 – February 2013</p>
	<p>EIS was awarded an Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) contract to support all United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) systems in 2012. Mr. Dietz was recruited to be technical lead to establish a performance testing implementation and establish processes to support the 112 distinct USCIS software systems, which spanned vastly disparate technologies and platforms.</p>
	<p>In this role, Mr. Dietz mentored performance testing staff on performance testing technologies, scripting techniques, and performance data analysis. He assisted USCIS with performance tuning and diagnosis and was the lead technical interface for EIS to their USCIS client.</p>
	<p>His performance testing implementation, which consisted of HP Performance Center, HP LoadRunner, Opnet Panorama, HP SiteScope, Visual Studio 2010 Web Performance Tests, and a series of custom developed .NET applications, was instrumental in their contract renewal in January 2013.</p>
