	<br/>
	<p>SOFTWARE ARCHITECT / LEAD DEVELOPER (Contractor) || Hewlett Packard, Herndon VA</p>
	<p>May 2007 – September 2011</p>
	<p>Mr. Dietz was brought to Hewlett Packard to design, develop, and implement a middle-tier software package to integrate 7 worldwide online systems. He designed and led the development of the Edge product, an SOA replacement technology for a middleware technology that was being retired.</p>
	<p>As a small team using the Agile Software Development Model, Mr. Dietz took ownership of numerous responsibilities beyond that of software architecture, design, and development. He was the project’s SQL Server DBA since inception, performed all Configuration Management duties and implemented Team Foundation Server for source code version control, workflow management, and managing the deployment operations to numerous software environments. He also played a significant role in performance evaluation of changes and production performance tuning operations.</p>
	<p>The design of the system includes multiple Windows services, ASP.Net web services interfaces, and an ASP.Net web application with a SQL Server backend. The implementation of the replacement technology into the production environment involved migrating hundreds of thousands of users who seamlessly transitioned to the Edge system without a single functional or performance problem. Mr. Dietz’ Edge implementation won Hewlett Packard the Visionary Award from one of their partner systems, stating that it was the most successful integration of systems in their history, which includes their product’s integration with over 3,000 companies and products.</p>
