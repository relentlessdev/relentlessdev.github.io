	<h1>John Dietz @ Northrop Grumman for NextGen</h1>
	<p>PERFORMANCE SPECIALIST (Contractor) || Northrop Grumman, McLean VA</p>
	<p>August 2010 – April 2011</p>
	<p>Mr. Dietz was brought to Northrop Grumman to evaluate and benchmark the performance characteristics of a proof-of-concept (POC) web 2.0 system called Next Generation Contractor Correlation and Accountability System (NG-CCAS). He was solely responsible for the design and implementation of a low-cost, high-volume load testing solution. Mr. Dietz has also been the sole resource dedicated to the identification of performance and concurrency issues and all load testing executions and analysis of the NG-CCAS application under various load profiles. His .NET development experience and engineering expertise made Microsoft’s Visual Studio load testing technology a viable solution in a Java environment. Mr. Dietz’ ability to design and implement a .Net load test resulted in an 80% reduction in initial purchase costs as well an 80% in annual license costs savings. He completed his operations and provided deliverables early and under budget.</p>
	<p>In addition to the load testing tasks, he was exclusively responsible for implementing and administering the DynaTrace server, an enterprise profiling application used to assist in the identification and diagnosis of performance bottlenecks. He also implemented and managed 2 SQL Server databases and the Visual Studio Load Test Rig. The POC effort required numerous ad hoc technical solutions to assist the overall project including the ability to generate volume data across multiple environments and client certificate management utilities required by the load test. Mr. Dietz has repeatedly shown the ability to quickly achieve mission-critical technical solutions.</p>
