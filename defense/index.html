	<h1>John Dietz @ Northrop Grumman Mission Systems</h1>
	<p>TEST AUTOMATION DEVELOPER – LEAD DEVELOPER (Contractor) || Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Fairfax VA</p>
	<p>SEPTEMBER 2000 – APRIL 2006</p>
	<p>Mr. Dietz was the lead Test Automation developer on the software verification team at Northrop Grumman Mission Systems. He was responsible for developing and enhancing automated regression test suites for Northrop Grumman’s Web, Client/Server, and Telnet-based versions of their software, Defense Travel System (DTS).</p>
	<p>He has successfully implemented multiple test automation frameworks that allow seamless integration of test steps and automated functions that simulate system activity. By broadening the scope of the regression suites, enhancing the reliability of the automated scripts, and automating the generation of regression test data matrices, Mr. Dietz has consistently developed a more extensive, dependable, fully-automated process for Northrop Grumman’s DTS Test Team.</p>
    <p>His automation frameworks have been deployed to multiple departments on the DTS project to provide staff with the ability to create automated tests without knowledge of scripting practices, which was an unprecedented evolution in the development life cycle environment. His architecture consisted of management applications developed in C# /VB.Net with a SQL Server database. The database supported both the management interface (ADO) and the WinRunner scripts (ODBC). The scripts simulate system activity to verify functionality of the DTS user interface, rules engines, reservation interfaces, XML processors, calculations engines, and disbursement engines.</p>
    <p>His work as the lead automation specialist has included software development in C#, VB.Net, WinRunner (TSL), LoadRunner, XML, XPath, HTML, VBA (Excel), Visual Basic 6, SQL, and database design and administration in SQL Server. With such an extensive computer background, Mr. Dietz consistently exceeded expectations of Software Testing with innovative technical solutions.</p>
