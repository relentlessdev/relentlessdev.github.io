	<h1>John Dietz @ Northrop Grumman Mission Systems</h1>
	<p>PERFORMANCE ANALYST – PRODUCTION ENGINEER (Contractor) || Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Fairfax VA</p>
	<p>June 2006 – May 2007</p>
	<p>Mr. Dietz was asked to return Northrop Grumman Mission Systems to be the lead performance analyst and production engineer for multiple mission-critical releases of the Defense Travel System (DTS) project. His primary responsibilities in this role are to develop scripts and custom utilities to monitor the production system and also to conduct performance evaluation on the DTS application prior to implementation in production. His responsibilities in this role include the design and development of multiple C# applications to monitor and manage various aspects of the DTS production and testing environments. These programs are positioned in a secure and complex 4-tier infrastructure. This required use of many advanced technologies such as secure .NET Remoting, SOAP over HTTPS, SNMP and SQL Server on a secure private network.</p>
	<p>His performance analysis skills have been used to design, develop, execute, and analyze the results of various load test operations. The load tests abide by DTS’ advanced security policies including PKCS #12 digital certificate encryption authentication and the Base 64- and URL-encoding of the dynamic signature upstream payload. He has leveraged his database background to integrate LoadRunner with SQL Server so that the results of hourly operations are sent to operations staff. Post-run investigations have included running profilers like YourKit and J2EE Probe against the Java instances and evaluating metrics from Oracle Enterprise Manager to determine the cause of bottlenecks. Mr. Dietz has been a key player in helping DTS transition from a zero-user application to a fine-tuned system able to processes over 22,000 unique logins per hour with average response times under a second.</p>

	<p>TEST AUTOMATION DEVELOPER – LEAD DEVELOPER (Contractor) || Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Fairfax VA</p>
	<p>SEPTEMBER 2000 – APRIL 2006</p>
	<p>Mr. Dietz was the lead Test Automation developer on the software verification team at Northrop Grumman Mission Systems. He was responsible for developing and enhancing automated regression test suites for Northrop Grumman’s Web, Client/Server, and Telnet-based versions of their software, Defense Travel System (DTS).</p>
	<p>He has successfully implemented multiple test automation frameworks that allow seamless integration of test steps and automated functions that simulate system activity. By broadening the scope of the regression suites, enhancing the reliability of the automated scripts, and automating the generation of regression test data matrices, Mr. Dietz has consistently developed a more extensive, dependable, fully-automated process for Northrop Grumman’s DTS Test Team.</p>
    <p>His automation frameworks have been deployed to multiple departments on the DTS project to provide staff with the ability to create automated tests without knowledge of scripting practices, which was an unprecedented evolution in the development life cycle environment. His architecture consisted of management applications developed in C# /VB.Net with a SQL Server database. The database supported both the management interface (ADO) and the WinRunner scripts (ODBC). The scripts simulate system activity to verify functionality of the DTS user interface, rules engines, reservation interfaces, XML processors, calculations engines, and disbursement engines.</p>
    <p>His work as the lead automation specialist has included software development in C#, VB.Net, WinRunner (TSL), LoadRunner, XML, XPath, HTML, VBA (Excel), Visual Basic 6, SQL, and database design and administration in SQL Server. With such an extensive computer background, Mr. Dietz consistently exceeded expectations of Software Testing with innovative technical solutions.</p>
