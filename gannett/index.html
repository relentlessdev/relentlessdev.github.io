			<h1>John Dietz @ Gannett</h1>
			<p>I've spent 4 years at Gannett working with some really amazing people and some really cool technologies. I've fulfilled a lot of different roles over my years on Gannett’s Content Solutions Platform, including platform architect, solutions architect, build master, and developer.</p>
			<p>We've done some really amazing things too, and made some huge changes to the platform since I got there. I've been lucky enough to help guide their application suite from windows to linux, .net to node js, vmware to chef, on-prem to the cloud, and a error-prone bureaucratic process to a sophisticated streamlined continuous delivery system.</p>
			<p>The platform architecture team that I'm currently working with is guiding the direction of a geographically distributed, highly available, event-sourced application set which powers the experience of 8.4 million unique daily visitors of the USA Today network sites.</p>
