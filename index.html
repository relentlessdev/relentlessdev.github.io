<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hello there, I'm John Dietz!</h1>
	<p>I'm the owner of <em>Integrity Test Solutions, LLC</em>. It's not a really a contracting company though; I'm not interested in empire building. It's just a vehicle to contract corp-to-corp so I can help you make great things happen. I've helped a lot of great companies do great things. <a href="/about">Read about some of my work at Gannett...</a></p>
